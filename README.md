# Review-of-Gryonoides

### Description
This repository contains the Darwin Core Archives for Gryonoides specimens from the material examined section of "...". The archive was produced by the authors from data contained in TaxonWorks and include occurrence data from 

1- Occurrence data [https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#occurrence](Occurrence Core)
2- Taxonomic changes [https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#taxon](Taxon Core)

The Darwin Core Archive was validated using the https://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/about.do tool.

### Summary
Darwin core archives have been emerged as the accepted data sharing standard forsharing occurrence data about organisms. These occurrences could be observations orspecimens in natural history collections. The standard is applied by natural history collections worldwide to share their data between various repositories, including Global Biodiversity Information Faculty (GBIF) and Integrated Digitized Bio collections(iDigBio). This repository can be repuroposed as an example template for publishing material examined as a DarwinCore Archive, accessable for data aggregators and conforming to community standards. This method can be used for any occurrence dataset, either as a the material examined, species monitoring observation records, ecology publication or natural history collection data.
