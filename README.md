# Review-of-Gryonoides

### Description
This repository contains a Darwin Core Archive template and instructions for revisionary taxonomists to use to publish their data to GBIF and Global Biotic Interactions. 


### Summary
Darwin core archives have been emerged as the accepted data sharing standard forsharing occurrence data about organisms. These occurrences could be observations orspecimens in natural history collections. The standard is applied by natural history collections worldwide to share their data between various repositories, including Global Biodiversity Information Faculty (GBIF) and Integrated Digitized Bio collections(iDigBio). This repository can be repuroposed as an example template for publishing material examined as a DarwinCore Archive, accessable for data aggregators and conforming to community standards. This method can be used for any occurrence dataset, either as a the material examined, species monitoring observation records, ecology publication or natural history collection data.

Publish data to GBIF and Globi

### How to create a Darwin Core Archive
1- fork repository
2- fill out template
3- zip folder

Not all fields need to be filled out except: occurrenceID, BasisOfRecord
