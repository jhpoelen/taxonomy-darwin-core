# A GitHub Approach to Publishing Darwin Core Formatted Occurrence Data

### Description
This repository contains a Darwin Core Archive template and instructions for revisionary taxonomists to use to publish their data as a Darwin Core Archive or Darwin Core Compliant CSV file. This repository contains the Darwin Core Archives for Gryonoides specimens contained in the publication "Biology and taxonomy of Teleasinae: Review of Gryonoides Dodd 1920 (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) ". The archive was produced by the authors from data contained in mx (Yoder et al. 2006â€“present).


### Summary
Darwin core archives have been emerged as the accepted data sharing standard forsharing occurrence data about organisms. These occurrences could be observations orspecimens in natural history collections. The standard is applied by natural history collections worldwide to share their data between various repositories, including Global Biodiversity Information Faculty (GBIF) and Integrated Digitized Bio collections(iDigBio). This repository can be repuroposed as an example template for publishing material examined as a DarwinCore Archive, accessable for data aggregators and conforming to community standards. This method can be used for any occurrence dataset, either as a the material examined, species monitoring observation records, ecology publication or natural history collection data.

Publish data to GBIF and Globi

### How to create a Darwin Core Archive
1- fork repository
2- use the Gryonoides_revision.csv file as a template
3- zip folder

Not all fields need to be filled out except: occurrenceID, BasisOfRecord

Occurrence data [https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#occurrence](Occurrence Core)

The Darwin Core Archive was validated using the https://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/about.do tool.
